I am a 3rd-year PhD student at NAVER LABS Europe and INRIA Grenoble - Rhône-Alpes, THOTH team, under the supervision of Julien Mairal, Diane Larlus, and Michael Arbel. I graduated from Mines Paris with a focus in Applied Mathematics and obtained a Master’s Degree in Mathematics, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision (MVA) from ENS Paris-Saclay (2021). I have also worked at Philips Research Paris (2021) on self-supervised learning from 3D medical images, at Weill Cornell, New York (2020) on phylogenetic tree reconstruction, and at Neural Concept, Lausanne (2019) on Geometric Deep Learning.

My current research focuses on visual representation learning, with an emphasis on leveraging large pretrained visual models for applications constrained by computational resources or data scarcity. I have worked on automatically learning data augmentation for supervised tasks, and on transferring generic representations from large pretrained models into smaller ones (knowledge distillation) and into 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes.
